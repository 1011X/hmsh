Hypermedia Shell
============================

Welcome to the glitch branch of the hypermedia shell!

This is a proof-of-concept created using [glitch.me](https://glitch.me). It's a Node.JS application that runs a shell program on the browser with hypermedia capabilities, and using the server's storage as a filesystem. You can try it out at [hmsh.glitch.me](https://hmsh.glitch.me).

My intention is to make hmsh an actual desktop application. However, due to personal technical limitations, it's a bit difficult to do so. A path I'm considering to accomplish this is to use [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo). Haven't accomplished much, but I'll keep trying.
